# Chess.com MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol][mcp] (MCP) server for Chess.com's Published Data API.

This provides access to Chess.com player data, game records, and other public information through standardized MCP interfaces, allowing AI assistants to search and analyze chess information.

[mcp]: https://modelcontextprotocol.io

## Features

- [x] Access player profiles, stats, and game records
- [x] Search games by date and player
- [x] Check player online status
- [x] Get information about clubs and titled players
- [x] No authentication required (uses Chess.com's public API)
- [x] Docker containerization support
- [x] Provide interactive tools for AI assistants

The list of tools is configurable, so you can choose which tools you want to make available to the MCP client.

## Usage

### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run chess-mcp with Claude Desktop is using Docker:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chess": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "pab1it0/chess-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Running with UV

Alternatively, you can run the server directly using UV. Add the server configuration to your client configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chess": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<full path to chess-mcp directory>",
        "run",
        "src/chess_mcp/main.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: if you see `Error: spawn uv ENOENT` in Claude Desktop, you may need to specify the full path to `uv` or set the environment variable `NO_UV=1` in the configuration.

## Development

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage dependencies. Install `uv` following the instructions for your platform:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

You can then create a virtual environment and install the dependencies with:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
uv pip install -e .
```

### Testing

The project includes a test suite that ensures functionality and helps prevent regressions.

Run the tests with pytest:

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run the tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```
